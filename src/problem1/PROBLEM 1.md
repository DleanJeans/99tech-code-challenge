## Task

Provide 3 unique implementations of the following function in JavaScript.

**Input**: `n` - any integer

_Assuming this input will always produce a result lesser than_ `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`.

**Output**: `return` - summation to `n`, i.e. `sum_to_n(5) === 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 === 15`.
