Has Vitest for these test cases:
```
✓ should return 1 for n = 1  
✓ should return 3 for n = 2 (1 + 2)  
✓ should return 6 for n = 3 (1 + 2 + 3)  
✓ should return 10 for n = 4 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4)  
✓ should return 15 for n = 5 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5)  
✓ should return 55 for n = 10  
✓ should return 5050 for n = 100  
✓ should return 500500 for n = 1000  
✓ should handle n = 0 (edge case)  
✓ should handle n = -1 (sum: -1 = -1)  
✓ should handle n = -2 (sum: -2 + -1 = -3)  
✓ should handle n = -3 (sum: -3 + -2 + -1 = -6)  
✓ should handle n = -5 (sum: -5 + -4 + -3 + -2 + -1 = -15)  
✓ should handle n = -10 (sum: -10 + ... + -1 = -55)
